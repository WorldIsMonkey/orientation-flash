# orientation-lts

A platform for editing content for WIM Orientation front-end.
Casually maintained by [Andrew Wang](https://github.com/A-Kun).

This project was started when Flash-based SNS game was still a thing. A rewrite using modern technologies is in the works. Check out the [orientation-ng](https://github.com/WorldIsMonkey/orientation-ng) project.

This project is in long-term support (LTS) mode, meaning patches may be made to correct software bugs, but no new features will be introduced that may cause regression. Any new features should go into the new [orientation-ng](https://github.com/WorldIsMonkey/orientation-ng) project.
