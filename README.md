# orientation-flash

A platform for editing and presenting content for Club WIM (World is Moe)'s Orientation/Welcome Party events, since 2014.

This project is no longer maintained, as a direct result of Adobe Flash Player's end-of-life (EOL) date of December 31, 2020.

This project was started when Flash-based SNS games were still a thing - remember Club Penguin and Happy Farm? An idea of a rewrite using modern technologies was proposed, but has never been able to be implemented due to manpower. Check out the ~~abandoned~~ [orientation-ng](https://github.com/WorldIsMonkey/orientation-ng) and [orientation-drupal](https://github.com/WorldIsMonkey/orientation-drupal) projects.

In the case that this project will still be used in the future - for event organizers, please read the [Question Review Guideline](/QuestionReviewGuideline.md).
